            <h2>Causes of Water Pollution</h2>
            <p>Water pollution is caused by a variety of factors that lead to the contamination of our water sources. Understanding these causes is the first step toward effective solutions.</p>

            <h3>Types of Water Pollution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chemical Pollution:</strong> Involves the discharge of harmful chemicals from industrial processes and agricultural runoff.</li>
                <li><strong>Biological Pollution:</strong> Occurs when pathogens from human waste, livestock, and wildlife contaminate water sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Pollution:</strong> Involves the introduction of physical materials such as plastics, metals, and sediment into water bodies.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="sources">
            <h3>Sources of Water Pollution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Agricultural Runoff:</strong> Fertilizers and pesticides from farms that wash into rivers and lakes.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial Discharges:</strong> Waste products released from factories into nearby water bodies.</li>
                <li><strong>Urban Development:</strong> Increased impervious surfaces lead to more runoff carrying pollutants.</li>
                <li><strong>Wastewater Treatment Plants:</strong> Sometimes discharge untreated or partially treated waste into water bodies.</li>
